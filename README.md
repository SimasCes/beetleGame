# Side-Scroller game
<img source="image/gameBeetle.png">
This was one of the first projects I ever did at university. It was to create a side-scroller game in JavaScript. I created a beetle character who has to collect branches and make it to a tent by night. If he hits any of the wasps or falls off he looses a life (there are 3 lives). You can try out and play the game here https://simasces.github.io/beetleGame/. Use arrow keys to move and space to jump.
